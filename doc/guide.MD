## Submitting code
Once you have your code, Do the following things:
- Name your python file your GitHub username, Make sure to follow the rules that apply for python variables i.e No spacing, Replace spaces and unsupported characters with an `_` (underscore)
- On top of your python code add this docstring:

  ```py
  """
  Weekly Challenge: <challenge_number here. i.e 6,7,8 etc.>
  
  Discord username: <discord_username_with_tag_here>

Once you done that, Upload your file to `Challenges/<challenge_number>` directory and finally open a pull request. From here, you don't have to do anything. We will review your code and if you're eligible, we will merge it.

Good Luck!
